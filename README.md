Explanation & Findings:
Data Cleaning:
The code drops the account with a missing trade history and converts each accountâ€™s trade history from a string to a list of dictionaries.

Metric Calculations:
For each account:

PnL is calculated as the sum of all realizedProfit values.
ROI is determined by dividing PnL by the total invested money (sum of quantity across trades).
Sharpe Ratio is computed from the per-trade returns (profit divided by quantity).
MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is computed from the cumulative profit curve.
Win Rate is the proportion of trades with a positive realizedProfit.
Ranking:
A composite score is calculated using the above metrics. Accounts are then sorted by this score to produce a ranking, and the top 20 accounts are selected.

Deliverables:

A Python script (or Jupyter Notebook) with the complete analysis.
A CSV file can be generated by saving metrics_df:

metrics_df.to_csv("calculated_metrics.csv", index=False)
A list of the top 20 accounts (top_20).
A report detailing this methodology, assumptions, and findings.
